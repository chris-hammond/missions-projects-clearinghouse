  heading: Overview
  text: >-
    The purpose of this project is to create a web based software capable of
    listing projects and developers who are interested in those projects for
    nonprofits. Unlike most existing solutions available on the internet, the
    relationship between project and developer will not be based on the monetary
    compensation offered by the project owner, and remitted to the developer,
    but rather, the projects will be defined by their value in growing,
    discipling and supporting the Kingdom of God. The developers are
    professionals and hobbyists who intend to use the talents God has given
    them, along with the experience and skills they have honed in order to
    further the Kingdom of God.

  heading: Objective
  text: >-
    The web site should have an administrator function where projects and
    developers can be vetted, or at least moderated.  The project listing side
    should have contact info for the organization wishing the work done,
    sufficient storage and presentation capabilities so that the organization
    can tell the story of the need in a compelling, multimedia way, and initial
    description of the specifics of the project.  The developer side should also
    collect contact information as well as specific skills and experience in a
    way that the web site can match project descriptions with developer skills. 
    This list must be able to grow organically with maybe some moderation by the
    administrators of the site.
